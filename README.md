## 🧩 Wordle Rush organized by Hive Helsinki in June 2025.

## 📘 Overview

Wordle Rush is a project inspired by the popular web-based word game Wordle, originally created by Josh Wardle.
The goal of this exercise was to study the logic and mechanics behind the game and build a series of programs that can analyze, assist, and even play Wordle automatically.

This project focuses on problem analysis, algorithmic reasoning, and hypothesis testing, while encouraging the use of any programming language, framework, or tools.

## 🎮 Game Summary

Wordle is a simple yet addictive puzzle where:

- The player must guess a 5-letter English word.

- There are 6 attempts per round.

- After each guess, the player receives feedback:

  - 🟩 Letter in the correct position

  - 🟨 Letter present but in the wrong position

  - ⬛ Letter not in the word

The objective is to find the hidden word in as few tries as possible.
All players share the same daily word, promoting comparison and discussion on social media.

## 🧠 Project Structure
1. Assistant

A tool that helps a Wordle player by:

Displaying all possible remaining words after each guess.

Using the known feedback (correct, misplaced, or absent letters).

Optionally featuring a user interface for easier interaction.

2. Player

An autonomous Wordle solver that:

Plays the game by itself, selecting the next word intelligently.

Implements and tests different strategies for guessing.

Can measure and compare performance between algorithms.

Key questions:

What makes a good strategy?

How can performance be measured?

What does optimal mean in this context?

3. Bonuses

Optional challenges for deeper exploration:

Recreate the original Wordle game.

Implement automated testing and performance measurement.

Investigate: Is it possible to cheat at Wordle?
